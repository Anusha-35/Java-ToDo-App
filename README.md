# Java To-Do App

This project is a simple **To-Do list desktop application built using Java Swing** as part of my internship task.  
The application allows you to add and delete tasks in a graphical interface, with tasks saved to a file so they persist between runs.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Add new tasks using a text field and button.
- Delete selected tasks with a button.
- Scrollable task list.
- Tasks are automatically saved to a `tasks.txt` file.
- Tasks are loaded from the file when the app starts.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Java (OpenJDK 21)
- Java Swing for GUI components (JFrame, JButton, JTextField, JList)
- File I/O for saving and loading tasks.

- The app window should open, and you can start adding or deleting tasks!

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `ToDoApp.java`: Main source code for the Java GUI application.
- `tasks.txt`: File that stores your tasks so they persist between runs.
